<p>Rather than writing an program that can play a single game well, why not write an AI that can play any game well?</p>

<p>My program is able to read games in XML format (The XML must follow the included game.xsd grammar).  You can run the game by running <code>start.py</code> It will then allow you to select the players (human, random, or AI), at which point, it will run the game.  The AI needs training to learn how to play well.  To train the AI, run <code>learningplayer.py</code>.</p>

<p>A sample game, Dominion, has been included, and is described in <code>dominion.py</code>.</p>
<h3>Capabilities:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Capable of playing non-deterministic games with hidden state.  Doesn't cheat to win.</li>
    <li>Able to learn different types of choices (For example, Ticket to ride has "Select turn action", "Select ticket", and "Draw card" choices).</li>
    <li>Capable of handling choices with different options available each time, and choices that allow selecting multiple options.</li>
    <li>Relatively fast runtime.  Random players can finish a game in about 5 seconds, AI players can finish a game in about 20 (On my computer)</li>
    <li>After 3,000 training games, wins against a random player about 80% of the time in Dominion (a quite complex game)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Doesn't learn deterministic games as fast, because the AI usually selects the same moves for all players while training.</li>
    <li>Can't handle choices that are not enumerable (For example, Monopoly bidding on properties)</li>
    <li>Plays position-dependent games poorly (For example, in chess, two positions can be very similar, but have drastic differences in actual power)</li>
    <li>Plays hidden-state-depending games poorly (For example, the AI doesn't try to guess your hand in Poker)</li>
    <li>AI currently doesn't take into account recent moves players have taken (In risk, if my opponent just moved armies closer to me, he is likely attacking)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <p>My learning player uses Temporal Difference learning (more specifically, Q-Learning).  This algorithm uses 2 Neural Networks:  The first ranks the current state of the game, and the second ranks each of the choices available to it.  It then takes one of the choices, and updates both neural networks based on the state it ended up in.</p>
  <p>The XML file that describes a game defines 4 different parts of a game: Pieces (such as cards, tokens), Collections (places to put your pieces), Actions(something a player does), and Turns(something many players do).</p>
  <h4>Pieces</h4>
  <p>Pieces have a <i>name</i> and children elements defining their attributes.  Attributes have a name, such as <i>color</i>, and can either be a static value (<i>red</i>), or point to another object</p>
  <h4>Collections</h4>
  <p>Collections also have a <i>name</i> and attributes. They also can contain visibility modifiers, defining who can see their contents, and what contents they can see (the first piece, all of the pieces, the count of the pieces)</p>
  <h4>Actions</h4>
  <p>Actions are made up of a series of steps.  Steps include <i>move-pieces</i>, <i>set-attribute</i>, <i>if</i>, and <i>loop</i>.</p>
  <h4>Turns</h4>
  <p>Turns point to a single action, and allow a series of players to perform an action in order.  A turn can also store an attribute, allowing you to store temporary values</p>
