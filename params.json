You can run the game by running `start.py` It will then allow you to select the players (human, random, or AI), at which point, it will run the game.  The AI needs training to learn how to play well.  To train the AI, run `learningplayer.py`.\r\n\r\nA sample game, Dominion, has been included, and is described in `dominion.py`.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
