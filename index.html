<p>Rather than writing an program that can play a single game well, why not write an AI that can play any game well?</p>

<p>My program is able to read games in XML format (The XML must follow the included game.xsd grammar).  You can run the game by running <code>start.py</code> It will then allow you to select the players (human, random, or AI), at which point, it will run the game.  The AI needs training to learn how to play well.  To train the AI, run <code>learningplayer.py</code>.</p>

<p>A sample game, Dominion, has been included, and is described in <code>dominion.py</code>.</p>
